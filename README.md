# Command Runner
Command Runner is a Spigot/BungeeCord plugin that accesses one or more MySQL database and runs the commands that are in the specified table(s). You create a "command set" with one or more commands, if there is only one command then it is run, if there are multiple commands there can be a delay set between each command. You can also specify a location where the command(s) should be run, the locations are set in the config file. All you have to do is get the commands into the database.
